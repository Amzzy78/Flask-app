<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin II Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground
            as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.</p>

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
            Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
            Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.</p>

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and
            survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot,
            along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

        <p>Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the
            Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the
            Fellowship of the Ring.

            Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves
            who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends
            and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

            He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more
            by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.</p>

            Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
            forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
            grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
            strongest of the thirteen companions</p>

        <p>Nori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori, and was a
            remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple, he played the flute, and he was very fond of
            regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins. Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a
            capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for
            regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue
            Mountains with his two brothers.</p>
        <blockquote>"Perhaps the most elusive member of The Company of Thorin Oakenshield, Nori is often in trouble with
            the Dwarvish authorities. Deciding it might be a good time to leave town, he readily joins the Quest for the
            Lonely Mountain, not realizing the journey ahead may well lead him into far more trouble than he has left
            behind. Nobody ever quite knows what the quick-witted and wily Nori is up to, except that it's guaranteed to
            be dodgy and quite possibly illegal. Despite rarely seeing eye-to-eye with his brothers Dori and Ori, he is
            nonetheless immensely loyal and will protect them by whatever means possible."</blockquote>

        <blockquote>"Endearing and likable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things
            without thinking. With a love of music and a fine singing voice, Bofur delights in good food and good
            company and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in

        <p>Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The
            Lord of the Rings.

            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring,
            and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a
            book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.

            Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the
            Undying Lands.</p>

            of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
